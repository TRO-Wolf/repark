# map — docs/perf

## Purpose

Committed performance baselines. A number whose environment was not recorded
is not a baseline (H-3). This directory is evidence plus the machine/profile
header; it is not a second measurement convention.

This file closes when the H-3 campaign archives to `docs/history/`.

- [engine-iceberg-analysis-2026-09-04.md](engine-iceberg-analysis-2026-09-04.md) — **PERF-ANALYSIS
  (2026-09-04, Fable 5.1 session):** the query-engine + Iceberg-integration performance analysis on
  a release module at 8-thread parity — eleven measured candidates ranked by isolated cost over the
  family floor (facade `collect()` 4,939 ms at 1e6×7; cubic `withColumn` chains 2,376 ms at depth
  100; Iceberg `count(*)` decoding every column 68/357 ms; the fanout splitter, cooperative
  writers, single-partition scans, per-statement manifest reads, `createDataFrame(tuples)`, the
  `avg` UDAF, RANGE frames, catalog round trips), the candidates measured and CLOSED, the
  unmeasured hypotheses, a nine-unit slate in build order, and every command. Raw per-iteration
  timings with start/end load:
  [engine-iceberg-analysis-2026-09-04-numbers.json](engine-iceberg-analysis-2026-09-04-numbers.json).
  Filed with two plural spellings normalised for the typos gate. Units cite a cell of this report and re-run its §6 command before and after.
- [dynamic-flatten-baseline.md](dynamic-flatten-baseline.md) — **PERF-DYNFLATTEN-1
  (2026-09-04):** 1e5 and 1e6 per-fixture wall / RSS / walks, Spark explode wall,
  ratio, row-set equality, and the three H-3 candidate rankings. Release profile
  only: a debug module inverts the ranking, so debug numbers are not a baseline.
  **PERF-DYNFLATTEN-2 (2026-09-04)** appends an "after" section: its own before/after
  pair measured back to back on one quieter host, never overwriting the earlier tables.
  Two runs from different hours are not one table — each carries its own noise floor and
  its own 1-minute load, and a cost is read against the floor of the run it came from.

- [facade-boundary-baseline.md](facade-boundary-baseline.md) — **PERF-FACADE-1
  (2026-09-04):** the `collect()` and `withColumn`-chain cells of PERF-ANALYSIS-1 §7.3,
  before and after, with the boundary controls that must not move. The before column is one
  battery run at `origin/main`; the after column is the median of three repeats and the floor
  is the spread of those three, so a cell inside its floor is not a result. Section 4 repeats
  both halves inside one process on one module — the load-independent measurement — because the
  two battery columns come from different hours. Section 2 records why the projection collapse
  was measured (a perfect collapse tops out at 140 ms) and deliberately not built.
