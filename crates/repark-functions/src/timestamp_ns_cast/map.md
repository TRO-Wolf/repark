# map — repark-functions/src/timestamp_ns_cast

## Purpose

ICE-TSNS-SQL-1 support. The parent `timestamp_ns_cast.rs` holds the two embedded Spark-door
casts to Iceberg `timestamp_ns` / `timestamptz_ns` and the `VALUES` timestamp-column conform the
`spark_ltz_timestamp_cast` analyzer rule calls.

## Contents

- `tests.rs` — the module's `#[cfg(test)]` suite: nine fraction digits from strings, an explicit
  offset versus the session zone, malformed strings under ANSI on and off, exact microsecond
  widening, an instant into a naive target as the session wall, a wall into a zoned target
  localized, the overflow refusal, the planning-time refusal of a non-temporal source, and the
  `VALUES` retype / mixed-row cast. Round 2 (2026-09-18): narrowing floors instants and
  localizes walls, a microsecond input keeps its ticks, same-kind widening overflows as the row
  path does, and a `VALUES` node with no nanosecond column is left alone.

- `values_evidence.rs` — **WO NTZ-STORE-DOORS-1 third re-verify fold (2026-09-29, RD4-1):**
  the syntactic evidence the parent's `VALUES` widening reads per cell. `values_cell_evidence`
  peels the `Alias` / non-null wrappers, at most one planner coercion `CAST` to a naive
  timestamp and any `± INTERVAL` literal arithmetic, then answers `Wall` (the embedded NTZ
  literal and casts, a naive microsecond literal, and `to_timestamp_ntz`,
  `make_timestamp_ntz` or `localtimestamp` when the call's own type is naive microseconds),
  `Timestamp` (a `TIMESTAMP` literal, the double
  `CAST` marker, a top-level `TRY_CAST` to `TIMESTAMP`, a cast under interval arithmetic),
  `NamedInstant` (`from_utc_timestamp`, `to_utc_timestamp`) or `None`. The parent pairs the
  `Timestamp` and `NamedInstant` answers with the rewritten type before it trusts them.
