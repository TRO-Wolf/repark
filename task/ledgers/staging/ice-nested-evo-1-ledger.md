# Unit ledger — ICE-NESTED-EVO-1 · adopt a Spark-evolved nested table, and nested DDL (RePark half)

## Round 1 (2026-09-17) — run 21a

**Date:** 2026-09-17 · **Branch:** `fix/ice-nested-evo-1` · **Base:** `origin/main` at `2c28bec7`
(fork pin RP-24 `8fb44a39`) · **Model:** Claude Opus 5 · **Policy:** [../../../AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md).
**Path:** STANDARD. `risk_tier: high` (schema evolution on the Iceberg commit path).
**Registry:** `ICE-NESTED-EVO-1` **OPEN**.

**Retires:** this ledger moves to `../completed/` when the unit's last commit lands.

**Why now.** Rating row V2-10d: a Spark table whose struct gained a child
(`ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN s.b STRING`) is unreadable in RePark
(`Arrow Schema Error … Incorrect number of arrays for StructArray fields, expected 2 got 1`), and
nested DDL (`CREATE TABLE … (s STRUCT<…>)`, `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN s.b`) is refused with no
registry row.

**Split.** The reader half is fork work — fork PR #292 (F-NESTED-EVO-1): nested struct, list and
map children matched by field id; a child the file lacks is filled from its `initial_default` or
NULL. It is not merged or pinned in this round. Pins that need it are marked
`FORK-292` below and flip green only after the orchestrator bumps the pin.

**Not in this unit:** the fork pin; `STATUS.md`; `crates/repark-iceberg/src/write/merge/`;
`crates/repark-spark/src/insert_*`.

## Oracle

`python/repark-parity/fixtures/torture/data/ice_nested_evo_1/oracle.json`, recorded 2026-09-17
by `python/repark/tests/_record_ice_nested_evo_1.py` (Spark 4.1.2 + iceberg-spark-runtime 1.11.0,
Hadoop catalog). v2 and v3 answer identically. The required-child refusal, re-recorded with the
JVM exception: `org.apache.spark.SparkException`, condition `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2045`, cause
`java.lang.IllegalArgumentException`, first line
`Unsupported table change: Incompatible change: cannot add required column: r`.

## PROPOSITION LEDGER — ICE-NESTED-EVO-1 — 2026-09-17

| Clause | Proposition (checkable) | Proof obligation | Verdict | Evidence / open question |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C-001 | An adopted Spark table whose struct gained `s.b` answers `SELECT id, s` as Spark does (`[(1,{a:1,b:None}),(2,{a:2,b:'y'})]`), v2 and v3, SQL and DataFrame doors. | Pin reads the committed tables after `register_table`, compares rows and Arrow types to `oracle.json`. | **OPEN** | |
| C-002 | The same tables answer the leaf projection `SELECT id, s.a, s.b` as Spark does, both doors. | Same harness. | **OPEN** | |
| C-003 | The same tables answer `WHERE s.b IS NULL` with `[1]`, both doors. | Same harness. | **OPEN** | |
| C-004 | An adopted Spark table whose list element struct gained `arrs.element.y` answers as Spark does, both doors. | Same harness on `list_add_v3`. | **OPEN** | |
| C-005 | An adopted Spark table whose map value struct gained `m.value.q` answers as Spark does, both doors. | Same harness on `map_add_v3`. | **OPEN** | |
| C-006 | `CREATE TABLE` with struct, array-of-struct and map-of-struct columns round-trips the types `DESCRIBE` shows in Spark. | Pin compares RePark `DESCRIBE` `data_type` to the oracle's. | **OPEN** | |
| C-007 | `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN s.c BIGINT` on a RePark-created table adds a nullable child; the read and `DESCRIBE` match Spark. | Pin on both doors (the DataFrame door reads). | **OPEN** | |
| C-008 | `ADD COLUMN arrs.element.y INT` adds a child to the list element struct; the read matches Spark. | Same. | **OPEN** | |
| C-009 | `ADD COLUMN m.value.q STRING` adds a child to the map value struct; the read matches Spark. | Same. | **OPEN** | |
| C-010 | `RENAME COLUMN s.a TO a2` renames the child; the read matches Spark. | Same. | **OPEN** | |
| C-011 | `DROP COLUMN s.b` drops the child; the read matches Spark. | Same. | **OPEN** | |
| C-012 | `ADD COLUMN s.r INT NOT NULL` on a table with rows refuses as Spark does (message `cannot add required column: r`) and leaves the table untouched. | Pin asserts the typed exception, message and no new metadata file. | **OPEN** | |
| C-013 | Every cell above has a registry row (FIXED or DECLARED) in `docs/spark-sql-iceberg-parity.md`. | Registry section present. | **OPEN** | |
