# v1.5.6 release notes (draft)

This draft collects one line per stored-value change as each unit of the 1.5.6 cycle lands, for
the release PR to edit into the notes.

## Stored values that change

- **Nanosecond values into a microsecond `TIMESTAMP` column read a naive wall in the session zone
  on the overwrite doors (ICE-TSNS-FLOOR-DOORS-1, R-009).** `INSERT OVERWRITE` (plain, with a
  column list, `BY NAME`, with a static `PARTITION`), `INSERT … BY NAME`, the MERGE insert arm
  (every spelling), `overwritePartitions` and `insertInto(overwrite=True)` now read a
  `timestamp_ns` wall in the session zone, as INSERT does. Before this release they read it as
  UTC, so in a session whose zone is not UTC every naive nanosecond value written through them
  moved by the zone offset, not only values before 1970: in America/New_York
  `2026-03-08 02:30:00.000000001` stored `1772937000000000` where INSERT stores
  `1772955000000000`.
- **A nanosecond value before 1970 with digits below the microsecond now floors on every door,
  `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` included.** Narrowed into a microsecond `TIMESTAMP` or `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`
  column, `-1 ns` stores `-1 µs` on every write door, INSERT into `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` among them;
  before, the overwrite doors above and every door into `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` truncated toward zero
  and stored `0`.
- **The read `CAST(ns AS TIMESTAMP_NTZ)` floors the same way.** `CAST` of a `timestamp_ns` or
  `timestamptz_ns` value to `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` in a query answers `-1 µs` for `-1 ns`, where it
  answered `0`, as `CAST(… AS TIMESTAMP)` already did.

Tables already written keep the values they hold; this release ships no migration.

## Keyed-table refusal follow-ups (ENC-1-RESIDUE-1, items 1 and 5)

- **A refused write to a table carrying `encryption.key-id` no longer leaves its staged
  Parquet behind.** When the commit refuses because the table is keyed, every file the
  write staged is deleted before the refusal returns; the refusal text is unchanged.
- **Every catalog registered on a session is now guarded, including one a Rust embedder
  builds directly.** `Session::register_iceberg_catalog` installs the encryption guard
  itself, so a directly-built catalog refuses a keyed write exactly as a builder's
  catalog does.
