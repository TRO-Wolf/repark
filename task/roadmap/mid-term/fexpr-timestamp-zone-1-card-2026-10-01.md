# FEXPR-TIMESTAMP-ZONE-1 — F.expr TIMESTAMP literals resolve in UTC, not the session zone

**Filed: 2026-10-01 from the overnight owner-items backlog** (source:
`/tmp/oc-worker/direct/wo/overnight-2026-09-29-owner-items.md`, line 72;
#888 re-verify 10). **Severity:** wrong results, not yet rated (owner).
**Status:** pre-existing. **Target:** mid-term.

## The divergence it records

`F.expr` TIMESTAMP literals resolve in UTC instead of the session zone (a
DataFrame `F.expr` door gap; SQL resolves them in the session zone).

## Repro (from the source description; re-measure on the day)

```python
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.session.timeZone", "America/New_York")
spark.sql("SELECT TIMESTAMP '2024-06-01 12:00:00'").collect()  # session zone
F.expr("TIMESTAMP '2024-06-01 12:00:00'")  # RePark: UTC; Spark 4.1.2: session zone
```

## Cause and suggested fix direction (a suggestion, not a decision)

The `F.expr` door parses TIMESTAMP literals without the session zone the SQL
door applies. Any fix direction is suggested by the verifier/orchestrator, not
a decision.

## Clauses (draft)

- **C-001** `F.expr` TIMESTAMP literals answer the SQL door's values under a non-UTC zone.
- **C-002** UTC and fixed-offset zones pinned as controls.
- **C-003** The neighbouring session-zone literal cells still answer Spark.
